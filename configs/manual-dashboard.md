Purpose\nThe Infrastructure Hub aligns all SENTRA AI systems — both local and external — under a single manual rhythm, controlled entirely by the Dashboard.\nNo background automation. No autonomous synchronization. Everything happens only when you open the dashboard or press a button.\n\n## 2. Core Principles\n- Simplicity First: All data is stored as human-readable Markdown or JSON files.\n- Human-led Rhythm: The Owner decides when the system “wakes up.”\n- Legal Traceability: Every file starts with the dual credit line.\n- Manual Control: Every action (rehydrate, memory save, rollup) is explicitly Owner-triggered.\n- Single Source of Truth: Context, logs, and memory are stored in hub/, agents/, and ops/ folders only.\n\n## 3. System Overview\nThe Dashboard is the command center. When opened, it triggers rehydrate. When “Save Memory” is pressed, it writes through mem.py. When “Rollup” is pressed, it runs the daily wrap-up.\n\n## 4. Rehydrate\nTriggered automatically on dashboard open. Reads version.json, latest session, and displays summary + red-flags.\n\n## 5. Memory Saving\nTriggered manually via dashboard. Dashboard executes mem.py for:\n- note / decision / issue → writes to hub/discussions/<date>.md\n- context → updates hub/version.json and bumps revision\n\n## 6. Rollup\nTriggered manually. Creates new session, runs health checks, updates ops/health/daily.md.\n\n## 7. Integration with LLMs and Local AI\n- Local AIs connect via local REST endpoints.\n- External LLMs (like ChatGPT) connect through Clipboard Bridge (manual) or optional read-only link.\n\n## 8.

Folder Architecture\nthe-infrastructure-hub/\n├─ hub/\n├─ agents/\n├─ ops/\n├─ configs/\n├─ scripts/\n└─ archives/\n\n## 10. Key Scripts\n- rehydrate.sh: Reads context, shows latest session.\n- mem.py: Adds notes/decisions/issues/context.\n- new_session.sh: Creates new session.\n- check_red_flags.py: Updates ops/health/daily.md.\n- bundle_archive.sh: Monthly archive.\n\n## 11. Legal & Compliance\n- Every file must contain the dual credit line.\n- Filenames lowercase only.\n- No auto-write without user action.\n- All text in Markdown/JSON.\n- System sleeps when dashboard is closed.\n\n## 12. Daily Rhythm\nMorning → Open Dashboard → Rehydrate\nDaytime → Add Memory\nEvening → Rollup\nMonthly → Archive Vault\n\n## 13. Advantages\n- Human-led, transparent, traceable.\n- Platform-independent, legally compliant.\n- Easy integration with both local and cloud AI.\n- Future-proof with manual rhythm preserved.
