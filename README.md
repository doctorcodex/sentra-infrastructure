# Agent Infrastructure Hub

## Overview

This repository provides a framework for managing and monitoring a team of agents. The system is designed with a focus on manual processes, human-readable memory and logs, and legal traceability. It uses a series of Python and shell scripts to manage agent discussions, context, and daily health checks.

The core philosophy is "memory as files," ensuring that all context, decisions, and logs are stored in a transparent and easily auditable format.

## Directory Structure

- `agents/`: Contains logs and data for each individual agent (e.g., `dexton`, `kade`, `rex`).
- `hub/`: Central storage for shared information.
  - `discussions/`: Daily logs of notes, decisions, and issues.
  - `sessions/`: Session-specific markdown files.
  - `version.json`: The "memory" of the system, tracking context and revision history.
- `ops/`: Operational scripts and data.
  - `health/`: Contains daily health reports generated by the `check_red_flags.py` script.
  - `notam/`: For "Notice to Airmen" or important incident reports.
- `scripts/`: Contains the core automation scripts for managing the hub.

## Core Scripts

This repository includes several scripts to automate tasks.

### `scripts/mem.py`

This script is used to manage the system's "memory." It allows you to record notes, decisions, issues, and context updates.

**Usage:**

- `python3 scripts/mem.py note "Your note here"`
- `python3 scripts/mem.py decision "Your decision here"`
- `python3 scripts/mem.py issue "Your issue description here"`
- `python3 scripts/mem.py context <key> <value>`

### `scripts/check_red_flags.py`

This script performs a daily health check on the repository and reports any "red flags."

**Checks Performed:**

- Version mismatch between `hub/version.json` and the latest session file.
- Missing daily logs for any agent.
- NOTAM (Notice to Airmen) entries for the current day.
- Low completion rates based on checklists in agent logs.

**Usage:**

- `python3 scripts/check_red_flags.py`
- `python3 scripts/check_red_flags.py --date YYYY-MM-DD` (to check a specific date)

### `scripts/fix_credits.py`

A utility script to normalize and enforce branding/credit lines at the top of all text files.

**Usage:**

- `python3 scripts/fix_credits.py --check` (dry run)
- `python3 scripts/fix_credits.py --apply` (apply changes)

### Shell Scripts

- `bundle_archive.sh`: Bundles and archives old files.
- `new_session.sh`: Likely creates a new session file.
- `rehydrate.sh`: Restores or sets up the environment from an archive.
- `rex_validate.sh`: A validation script, possibly for the agent 'rex'.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3

### Setup

No special setup is required. The scripts are designed to be run directly from the repository root.

## Typical Workflow

1.  **Start of Day**: Run `python3 scripts/check_red_flags.py` to get a daily health report.
2.  **During the Day**:
    - Use `python3 scripts/mem.py note ...` to record observations.
    - Use `python3 scripts/mem.py decision ...` to log important decisions.
    - Use `python3 scripts/mem.py context ...` to update the shared context in `hub/version.json`.
3.  **Maintenance**: Occasionally run `python3 scripts/fix_credits.py --apply` to ensure all files have the correct branding.
